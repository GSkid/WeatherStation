		<p> Hi! My name is Grant Skidmore, a recent UC Santa Cruz graduate with an interest in embedded software engineering and the weather. This is not my first weather-related embedded systems project; my senior thesis was a smart irrigation system to reduce wastewater consumption by utilizing an IoT network of sensor nodes to gather real-time environmental data to effectively determine when and where to water. Because of this, I want to thank Henry Tuckfield and Brian Naranjo for their help with desigining some of the sensors (mostly part selection) as their assistance was invaluable for me during our thesis work. For more information about myself and my other projects, please visit my <a href="https://gskid.github.io" class="link">online portfolio website</a>.<br><br><br><br>I had a lot of fun with this project. Many of the necessary concepts were new to me, such as how to host a website using a raspberry pi (especially without a static IP) and allowed me to connect my skills in embedded software engineering with my work in IT networking. That being said, I'm really happy with the direction of this proejct and its results especially considering the fact that anyone can directly see the project in action through this website. And for those interested, you can view the source code for both the website and the project on my <a href="https://github.com/GSkid/WeatherStation" class="link">github repository</a>. You can also find more information about how each file works both in the readme and in the comments of the C++ and python source files. If you have any questions about the project, about job opportunities, or about contributing to the proect, you can reach me at grant.skidmore@gmail.com. Thanks for checking out the weather data api website!</p>
