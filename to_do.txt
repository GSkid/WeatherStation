# Stuff still needed to do before website hosting

1. Build the weather sensors (light, temp, pressure, wind speed, wind direction, precip)
	a) Map the sensors to gpio pins
	b) Fix the D_Class object's member variables, constructors, and methods

2. Add more information to the website pages
	a) Update the info and change formatting on the home page
	b) Add information on the About Me page (change name too) and reference portfolio website

3. Create the control loop for the sensor node
	a) Sleep for 15 minutes
	b) Wake up and read sensors
	c) Send sensor data to rpi
	d) Go back to sleep

4. Create the control loop for the rpi
	a) Check for rf24 messages from the sensor node
	b) When a message is received, update the D_Class object members
	c) Log the data to the data stream file
	d) Call the python neural network forecast file
	e) Log the results to the Weather Data's csv file for output

4. Set up the rpi to host a website using no_ip
	a) Sign up with no_ip for a static ip address
	b) Install apache and anything else necessary for hosting on rpi
	c) Verify that both c++ file and python file can be executed at same time
	d) Check that webiste can be reached through network
	e) Check that website can be reached from outside network
